That is the goal and I am determined that we will get there.\"Today, Hancock said from that same podium that the UK had beaten that goal by more than 22,000.Striking an upbeat tone, Hancock said: \"I knew it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal.\" Critics might point out that the goal wasn't the only thing to come out of Hancock's mouth that could be called audacious. In the numbers counted, thousands of tests have been sent out to members of the public, but not necessarily returned.'Jonathon Ashworth, the opposition Labour party's shadow health secretary, has already issued a statement, accusing the government of fiddling the numbers.'\"Increasing testing is an important milestone. But many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out.\"The issue of testing didn't need to become so political.'When the UK gave in to pressure to reverse its March 12 decisions to abandon mass community testing on April 2, it didn't need to set itself a specific target or a specific deadline. Indeed, it seems very unlikely that any scientific or medical advice would have produced a round number like 100,000 or a neat date such as the end of a month. These promises were based on political choices made by the government and it is entirely reasonable that critics expected the target to be met.It is, however, also reasonable for critics to point out that the date and the number of tests carried out is entirely arbitrary and what really matters is a coherent purpose for those tests being carried out \u2014 such as rolling out a contact tracing program.'So, while the UK government can be proud of its extraordinary expansion of testing in such a short period of time \u2014 and no one can deny that more testing is undeniably a positive thing \u2014 it's reasonable that critics would find any backslapping for simply keeping its own promise somewhat unedifying.''"}

Why shut down the economy for this?Here are several reasons why coronavirus is more dangerous than the flu -- and why extra precautions are needed:Coronavirus is much more contagious.A person with the'flu infects an average of about 1.28 other people. A person with'novel coronavirus infects an average of about 2 to 3 other people.Coronavirus has killed at a much faster rate.Between October 2019 to early April 2020, the flu killed up to 331 people a day, according to the preliminary CDC numbers. From February 6 through'April 30, the coronavirus killed an average of more than 739 people per day in the US.Coronavirus can be spread for many days without symptoms.With the flu, people typically start feeling sick one to four days after infection, with'symptoms often showing up within two days, the CDC says. That means people will know they're sick fairly soon and will likely stay home.But with coronavirus, symptoms typically appear four or five days after exposure, and the incubation lasts up to 14 days. You can get a flu vaccine but not a coronavirus vaccine.Unlike the flu, there's no option to get a vaccine for the coronavirus to protect against infection or to reduce the severity of symptoms.

That is the goal and I am determined that we will get there.\"On Friday, Hancock said from that same podium that the UK had beaten the goal by more than 22,000.Ambiguous numbers: Critics might point out that the goal wasn't the only thing to come out of Hancock's mouth that could be called audacious. In the numbers counted, thousands of tests have been sent out to the public, but not necessarily returned.'Jonathon Ashworth, the opposition Labour party's shadow health secretary, has already issued a statement, accusing the government of fiddling the numbers.'\"Increasing testing is an important milestone. But many would have expected the 100,000 promise to have been met by actually carrying out testing, not simply because 39,000 kits had been mailed out,\" he said.The issue of testing didn't need to become so political.'When the UK gave in to pressure to reverse its March 12 decisions to abandon mass community testing on April 2, it didn't need to set itself a specific target or a specific deadline. Indeed, it seems very unlikely that any scientific or medical advice would have produced a round number like 100,000 or a neat date such as the end of a month. These promises were based on political choices made by the government and it is entirely reasonable that critics expected the target to be met.It is, however, also reasonable for critics to point out that the date and the number of tests carried out is entirely arbitrary and what really matters is a coherent purpose for those tests being carried out \u2014 such as rolling out a contact tracing program.'So, while the UK government can be proud of its extraordinary expansion of testing in such a short period of time \u2014 and no one can deny that more testing is a positive thing \u2014 it's reasonable that critics would find any backslapping for simply keeping its own promise somewhat unedifying.''"}

A person with'novel'coronavirus infects an average of'about 2 to 3 other people.Coronavirus has killed at a much faster rate.Between October 2019 and early April 2020, the flu killed up to 331 people a day, according to the preliminary CDC numbers.From February 6 through'April 30, the coronavirus killed an average of more than 739 people per day in the US.Coronavirus can be spread for many days without symptoms.With the flu, people typically start feeling sick one to four days after infection, with'symptoms often showing up within two days, the CDC says. That means people will know they're sick fairly soon and will likely stay home.But with coronavirus, symptoms typically appear four or five days after exposure, and the incubation lasts up to 14 days.You can get a flu vaccine but not a coronavirus vaccine.Unlike the flu, there's no option to get a vaccine for the coronavirus to protect against infection or to reduce the severity of symptoms.

Like the US, neighboring countries to the south are also wrestling with Covid-19. Over the weekend, Brazil surpassed 100,000 cases of the virus.The virus has given way to some of the administration's long-standing efforts to curtail immigration, including closing off the border. Senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, the architect of many of the administration's immigration policies, has previously tried to use diseases, including influenza and the mumps, as grounds to tighten the border.In recent days, President Trump has repeatedly remarked on the conditions in Latin America, suggesting in a tweet that California \"doesn't want people coming over the Southern Border\" now there are rising coronavirus cases in Mexico. He also teased imposing restrictions on Brazil last week. Over the weekend, Trump also spoke with Interim President Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez of Bolivia and President Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez of the Republic of Paraguay'to discuss the response to the pandemic, offering to provide assistance to both countries. Earlier in the year, the administration restricted travel from China and Iran. It later expanded those restrictions to most foreign nationals who were in Europe's Schengen Area \u2014 26 countries stretching from Iceland to Greece \u2014 and the United Kingdom and Ireland. Trump has heralded those efforts in his defense of the administration's response to the coronavirus. The US has curtailed travel on its borders and invoked public health law to implement strict measures on the US-Mexico border, which have also led to the swift removal of thousands of migrants, including children, and people seeking asylum.

As things stand, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to gather EU leaders and China's President Xi Jinping in the eastern German city of Leipzig on September 14.But China's response to Covid-19 has left a bitter taste in the mouths of European officials. From draconian clampdowns on its own citizens to accusations of spreading misinformation in Europe, this crisis has been a reminder that closer engagement with China comes with risks.'Indeed, pulling China closer to European values on human rights, climate change and multilateralism is the sort of thing leaders' legacies are made of. And while the Leipzig summit is far from a make-or-break moment in Europe's relationship with China, this level of fanfare has a lot to live up to.However, there is a real sense in Brussels that the pandemic has led to a reset in European thinking on China.Blockmans is referring to a communique released by the EU Commission in March 2019, in which it described China as \"a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance\".In the context of coronavirus, that Chinese model of government is concerning EU officials.\"It's all about seeing which [political] system is better at handling the virus. Is it a system that allows personal liberties? Or is it single-party autocracy where you can impose measures without worrying too much,\" said one EU official working across external affairs.This lack of trust seems to be taking hold across Brussels. Over the weekend, the EU's Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, said in an interview with France's Le Journal du Dimanche that Europe had been \"na\u00efve\" in its dealings with China. He went on to acknowledge that China has a \"different understanding of the international order.\"So, where does this all leave what was supposed to be the year where China and Europe finally got on the same page? At the time of writing, very few believe that the Leipzig summit will be as Merkel and co. first imagined.On one hand, the EU's calculation on China hasn't changed: It's still desirable not to get squashed between the two great superpowers, China and America. On the other, recent history shows China to be an unreliable partner who divides opinion among EU member states.Sooner or later, Europe will have to weigh these two realities up and decide exactly how much that diplomatic independence from America is really worth.Read the full story here."}

It's a common sentiment: In a survey by Hong Kong University between March and April, more than 40% of respondents showed symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or any combination of the three.These numbers may be even higher, in reality, due to under-reporting; many Hong Kongers are reluctant to talk openly about or disclose mental illness due to deep-rooted social stigma and insufficient mental health education.Activists and educators have been working for years to break down this stigma, but they say the fight has taken on a new urgency, as people buckle under the weight of two back-to-back crises with no immediate relief in sight.Read the full story:"}

Over the past week, about 2,000 people died daily in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Why the increase? The sharp increases in the two models are tied to relaxed social distancing and increased mobility in the US. States across the country -- including Florida, Colorado, Indiana, Nebraska and South Carolina -- have eased restrictions in an attempt to revive a sputtering economy and calm restless residents.IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that other factors included states adding presumptive coronavirus deaths to their statistics and the rising number of cases in some meatpacking plants in the country.He said states have to balance their actions.The risk of reopening: The projections make clear that these reopenings come with fatal risks.\"It's simple logic,\" CNN's senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen said. \"When you tell people, 'Hey, you can go to bars, you can get your nails done, you can go to a restaurant,' those numbers are going to go up.\"The novel coronavirus's incubation period -- or the time from exposure to developing symptoms -- ranges from two to 14 days,'according to the CDC, and the virus can even'spread among people who show no symptoms'at all.

The US has yet to make a formal assessment public.Not certain: A third source, also from a Five Eyes nation, told CNN that the level of certainty being expressed by Pompeo and Trump is way out in front of where the current Five Eyes assessment is. This source acknowledged that there is still a possibility that the virus originated from a laboratory, but cautioned there is nothing to make that a legitimate theory yet.The source added that \"clearly the market is where it exploded from,\" but how the virus got to the market remains unclear.But without greater cooperation and transparency from the Chinese it's impossible to say with total certainty, the first official added.What is the Five Eyes? The Five Eyes alliance is made up of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- and the countries share a broad range of intelligence in one of the world's tightest multilateral arrangements.The third source said it is also possible the US is not sharing all of its intelligence. While the overwhelming majority is shared among the Five Eyes members, there are pockets of information that each country keeps to itself.The assessment follows repeated claims by Trump and Pompeo that there is evidence the virus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Read more:"}

It found that 49% were discharged, 33% died and 17% continued to receive care at date of reporting.The study also showed that of patients put on a ventilator, 53% died, 20% were discharged, and 27% remained in the hospital.Researchers also found that, along with underlying issues such as lung, heart and kidney disease that are already known to worsen outcomes, being male or obese were also significant factors associated with Covid-19 deaths in UK hospitals.This could be because obese people have a reduced lung function and potentially more inflammation in the fatty tissue under the skin and around internal organs, which could contribute to a possibly life-threatening overreaction of the body's immune system, researchers said.Remember: The study, which was funded by the UK government, has not yet been peer-reviewed. Derek Hill, Professor of Medical Imaging, University College London (UCL), called the research \"extremely impressive\" but warned that it shows a \"snapshot of outcomes\" and that many patients who were included are still in hospital, so the mortality and survival rates are subject to change.\"This is an especially large study so it provides helpful insights into the symptoms of Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital.'As has been reported many times, this is not like flu in who gets seriously ill or in mortality: young children seem to have low risk and pregnant women do not have an increased risk of serious illness, and it is deadlier than flu,\" Professor Hill said in a written statement released by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Wednesday."}

They described the case of a'6-month-old girl admitted to the hospital with the disease and later also diagnosed with coronavirus.What is Kawasaki disease? It's a rare childhood illness that causes the walls of the blood vessels in the body to become inflamed and can limit blood flow to the heart. It is usually treatable and most children recover without serious problems, but it can be deadly. What causes it? No one knows what causes Kawasaki disease, but some studies have pointed to a link between viruses or a bacterial infection.The US case: The child was initially diagnosed with a viral infection, the Stanford team said, and later tested positive for Covid-19. On the second day she had a fever and a blotchy rash. A chest x-ray showed a small white spot in her mid-lung, the team reported'in the journal Hospital Pediatrics. The baby's symptoms appeared to be Kawasaki disease and she was treated. Two weeks after she was discharged, the baby had no respiratory symptoms and is doing well.Further research: The authors of the study suggest that since the coronavirus is new, and not all symptoms in children are known, scientists will want to further research the potential association of Kawasaki Disease with Covid-19.Dr. Brad Segal, who worked on the case, said the team was surprised when the test came back positive for Covid-19. \u201cIn hindsight, looking at it, it's not entirely shocking that this association was possible,\u201d he said, adding that Kawasaki disease itself is often preceded by a respiratory or gastrointestinal illness.Segal doesn't believe they have seen any other cases of Kawasaki associated with coronavirus at his hospital. He thinks that if this is a complication associated with the coronavirus then it is most likely uncommon.'For further explanation of Kawasaki disease, read our coverage here:"}

The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health, gives little other detail.People who were older and those with more underlying health conditions fared worse than younger and healthier patients, the researchers found.More research needed: The authors concluded that the male gender is a risk factor for worse outcomes of Covid-19, regardless of age and underlying health conditions. They said this will need to be studied with a larger group of patients to determine if it is accurate, although some earlier studies have noted a similar trend.'Other factors could be at play: Scientists will also want to look at data from patients in other countries since there are demographic elements that could be a factor. In China, for example, 50% of men smoke, compared to 5% of women, according to earlier research, and smoking is thought to be tied to more severe cases of the disease.

The United States, she says, will need a'\"breakthrough\"'in testing to screen large numbers of people.According to Birx, that breakthrough is antigen testing. What antigen tests do: Often used to check for the flu and strep, antigen tests look for pieces of a virus -- often the proteins that cover its surface.How that differs from most coronavirus tests: These look for the virus' genetic material and require a number of chemicals to run, many of which are in short supply. The tests can also take hours to run.A quicker solution? Antigen tests are simpler -- and potentially less reliable -- but they can provide results in as little as 15 minutes, according to the US'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Why doesn't the US already have multiple tests? For starters, the tests are not easy to make, and validating their accuracy can be time-consuming and expensive. For another, there hasn't been a big market for them before now.WHO cautions against them: While some companies claim to have developed rapid antigen tests, the World Health Organization is'cautioning'against their use -- at least for now, until more is known.Read more about how antigen tests work:"}

The United States, she says, will need a'\"breakthrough\"'in testing to screen large numbers of people.According to Birx, that breakthrough is antigen testing. What antigen tests do: Often used to check for the flu and strep, antigen tests look for pieces of a virus -- often the proteins that cover its surface.How that differs from most coronavirus tests: These look for the virus' genetic material and require a number of chemicals to run, many of which are in short supply. The tests can also take hours to run.A quicker solution? Antigen tests are simpler -- and potentially less reliable -- but they can provide results in as little as 15 minutes, according to the US'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Why doesn't the US already have multiple tests? For starters, the tests are not easy to make, and validating their accuracy can be time-consuming and expensive. For another, there hasn't been a big market for them before now.WHO cautions against them: While some companies claim to have developed rapid antigen tests, the World Health Organization is'cautioning'against their use -- at least for now, until more is known.Read more about how antigen tests work:"}

While it said Japan's economy is likely to improve as the outbreak wanes, the central bank added that \u201cfuture developments are extremely unclear.\u201d Officials had earlier predicted growth between 0.8% and 1.1% for 2020.The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady Monday at its policy meeting, which usually lasts two days but was shortened to just half a day this month. But it did announce more easing measures as it tries to offset economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and address corporate funding strains. The central bank said it would now buy an unlimited amount of government bonds, scrapping an annual cap of 80 trillion yen ($745 billion). The move was largely symbolic, since the central bank has in recent years been buying about a quarter of that amount annually, so it had a lot of room to increase its purchases even without removing the cap. However, Monday's announcement sends the message that Japan will do whatever it takes to shore up its economy. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has already committed roughly $1.1 trillion to protecting the country from virus-related fallout.Japan's economy had been flirting with recession even before the outbreak. The world's third-largest economy shrank in the fourth quarter of 2019 as it absorbed a sales tax hike and grappled with the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis, a powerful storm that hit the country last fall.

Many are concerned that reopening too soon could prompt a'second wave of infectionsIn stages: It will require thinking critically about which elements of society are most essential to get back to work, implementing safety measures as they are reopened and ensuring diagnostic testing and'contact tracing'are in place.Finding the cause of a rebound: \"What we don't know is, (if) we go slightly back to normal, which activities create the risk of a rebound?\" Gates said.'Ramp up testing: \"We need to put in place a very dense testing regime so you would detect that rebound going back into exponential growth very quickly and not wait for the ICUs to fill up and there to be a lot of deaths. If you see the hot spot, you kind of understand the activities causing that,\" he said. Planning for reopening: States should focus on \"high value\" segments of the economy such as schools, manufacturing and construction, and should figure out how to operate those things with masks and social distancing, Gates said. Continue tracking: Once some schools and businesses get back to work, communities should continue to track the effects on infection rates, he said. But it will take time. \"The inequality has gotten greater in education, so if we can figure out how to do K through 12 in the fall, that would be good,\" Gates said.

It's the same story around the world.President Donald Trump thinks pent-up demand will ensure that the US economy takes off when normal life creaks open and once customers are free to shop and spend again. But even if the virus were waning across the US -- which it isn't -- shops, restaurants, bars and movie theaters would likely reopen at reduced capacity. And there's no guarantee those other jobs will ever come back.Fewer workers will mean fewer people with money to buy cars and go on vacation -- which will mean that industries like tourism, entertainment and hospitality have a long haul.

Its director, Romain Cools, told CNN that he hopes that by encouraging Belgians to eat more frites at home it will, \"enable our processors to avoid food waste by processing more potatoes and store them in our freezers -- which are nearly full now.\"Belgians typically eat frites once a week, but mainly outside their homes in friteries or restaurants. Coors said this is \"contrary to other countries like the United States, where fries are often a side dish for their meals.\"Belgian potato farmers are facing a surplus of 750,000 tons of potatoes this year that risk being destroyed because of the measures in place to stop the spread of Covid-19, according to the latest Belgapom data.\"By eating an extra portion during this crisis they could collaborate with farmers and the industry to avoid food losses,\" added Cools.World's largest frozen fries exporter: With almost all food outlets closed in the country and across Europe, normal consumption patterns have been disrupted which Belgapom estimates has caused a worldwide decrease in the consumption of fries by 40% since the beginning of the pandemic.This has huge implications on the Belgian potato growers who are the world's largest exporter of frozen fries -- with the majority of their products going to caterers and professional kitchens in 160 countries around the world.According to Belgapom's figures, 2.3 million tons of frozen french fries were supplied globally by Belgian producers in 2019.To help citizens use up the extra potatoes, the regional agriculture agency of Wallonia, Apaq-W and VLAM are promoting local and seasonal recipes through dedicated websites to use up excess Belgian potatoes and encouraging people to post their dishes on social media.

Now the 45-year-old walks the city's streets alone'to kill time and keep away from his neighbors.Vigilantly practicing social distancing at home isn't an option for Lum. He lives in one of Hong Kong's \"cage homes,\" subdivided apartments that often have space for only a bed and some clothes. His closest neighbor is just a few feet away, inside the same room.Cage homes are'usually smaller than 100 square feet,'only 25 square feet larger than most of the city's prison cells.'Bathrooms are mostly communal and often there are no kitchens -- just plug-in hot plates. Units are mostly divided by makeshift or removable walls.Lum, who is unemployed, said he pays 1,800 Hong Kong dollars ($232) for an apartment divided between 10 people.Lum's situation is extreme, but not unusual. Nine in 10 people in Hong Kong live in an area smaller than 753 square feet -- or 70 square meters -- and yet pay some of the highest rents and property prices in the world. The average cost of a home was more than $1.2 million last year,'according to real estate investment firm CBRE.To make things worse, many public areas are closed due to the pandemic. Libraries are shuttered. Jungle gyms in parks are taped off. Restaurants have slashed capacity, and bars have been forced to close, unless they serve food. Public gatherings are limited to four people.Despite having had the virus since January, Hong Kong has recorded fewer than 1,050 infections and 4 deaths, so few citizens disagree with the restrictions. But that doesn't make them easy to live with -- especially for those like Lum who can't easily stay home.\"I'm so lonely,\" Lum said. \"There isn't that same atmosphere on the streets like there was before. So few people sit in the parks. People used to watch the children play and the elderly play badminton.\"Read more here."}

They knew they'd be working hard to keep guests happy as they traversed the world's oceans, but they weren't expecting it to be that different from the many other excursions they'd completed.Instead, as the coronavirus pandemic spread, the Deliziosa would unwittingly sail into history.When it set off on its trip, the 965-feet long vessel was among thousands of cruise ships plying the world's oceans. By the time the Deliziosa arrived back to Italy this week, it was'the last cruise ship still at sea'carrying significant numbers of passengers.Those on board who completed the voyage have been revealing what it was like to cruise around the planet while the world descended into crisis -- as destination after destination was struck from their itinerary, amid mounting fears the virus would climb aboard and wreak havoc.Find out what they did in this exclusive piece.

But US President Donald Trump turned what should have been a simple scientific summary into a puzzling stream of dangerous ideas about somehow streaming light into the body and suggestions about injecting disinfectants.Here's what was said: Bill Bryan, a senior official at the US Department of Homeland Security, said studies on the virus showed bleach kills coronavirus in about five minutes, and isopropyl alcohol destroys it even faster. He also said the virus dies quickest under direct sunlight, and that temperature and humidity affect how long the virus survives.This was Trump's take:It was not immediately clear how Trump would propose bringing light into the body.Scientists were horrified by his claims. Multiple experts warned after Trump's briefing that nobody should ingest disinfectant, and that it simply doesn't work.The World Health Organization says on its website that exposing yourself to the sun or high temperatures does not prevent Covid-19, and warns specifically against using ultraviolet lamps, including tanning lamps, to try to kill virus. \"UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation,\" the WHO cautions.Too much UV light damage can lead to skin cancer.And chlorine bleach is toxic: it can and does kill people who drink it.

Most deaths, they warned, could result from a lack of ventilators.Read more about the situation in Japan:"}

Conflicting messages on when to reboot the economy, the need for testing and the possibility of a resurgence of the virus combined with Trump's effort to suppress facts that jar with his insistence that the end of a nightmare likely to last many more months is near.In another bizarre twist, Trump produced Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to walk back his remarks that the coronavirus challenge could be more difficult in the fall.'Trump claimed that Redfield had been \"totally misquoted\" by the media. But under questioning from reporters, Redfield confirmed that he had in fact made the remarks that angered Trump.It accurately described Redfield warning that if a coronavirus resurgence came at the same time as the flu season, hospitals could be overwhelmed.The President also openly clashed with his top public health officials on the likelihood of the virus returning for another assault in the fall -- saying only \"embers\" of disease were likely that could be easily put out.The President did break with Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp,'saying he \"strongly disagrees\" with aggressive plans'to open businesses including hair salons on Friday as pro-Trump southern states look to ease stay-at-home orders.Read the full analysis:"}

A ventilator is a device that forces air into the lungs of patients who cannot breathe on their own because of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.Other, smaller reports have indicated that patients who need ventilation are unlikely to survive.Luckily, just 12% of the patients in the study needed ventilators, Dr. Safiya Richardson at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Northwell Health, and colleagues found.But this study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, shows how dire the outlook is for patients with severe Covid-19 disease.The team looked at the electronic health records of 5,700 patients with coronavirus disease hospitalized at Northwell Health. Final outcomes were known for 2,634 of them.The records support what doctors have been saying about the coronavirus: most people who become severely ill have some sort of so-called underlying condition. More than half, or 57%, had high blood pressure, 41% were obese and 34% had diabetes.They also confirmed that men were more likely to die than women, and no one under the age of 18 died.The symptoms of infection were far from clear-cut. About a third of all patients showed up with fevers, 17% were breathing too fast and just under 30% needed extra oxygen. On average, patients were sent home after four days.But 14% were treated in intensive care, 3% needed intensive dialysis and 21% died.Since final data was only available on about half of the patients, it's possible that more of those on ventilators survived, the researchers said -- something that would drive down the 88% fatality rate for that group."}

This matters, said Dr. Caroline Buckee, Harvard associate professor of epidemiology and the associate director of the university's Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics.'Knowing the location of the virus is key to relaxing social distancing and returning to normalcy, Buckee told a symposium sponsored by Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the New England Journal of Medicine.The lack of testing capacity is a big problem because the disease has \u201ca very broad clinical spread,\u201d Buckee said. So even when people show up at the hospital and get tested there are many more cases in the community, including mild and asymptomatic cases. \u201cAnd those are the people that are spreading the disease,\u201d she said.It's important to learn whether people who have recovered can still spread the disease, noted NEJM editor Dr. Eric Rubin. Buckee added that without knowing the answers, the nation could reopen too soon and risk a deadly second pandemic wave.\u201cRight now, we don't have good estimates for where we are on the epidemic curve in different places. So, discussions of relaxation of physical distance, which do seem to be having an effect, curbing some of the worst impacts of the outbreak, need to be based on the capacity to test people so we know where we are,\u201d she said."}

For instance, it must include not only safety protocol within workplaces, but guidelines for public and private transportation, and how to control density and social distancing."}

It shows a country with different zones, with a different circulation intensity,\" Silvio Brusaferro, head of the National Institute of Health said during a press conference on Friday.The Institute said that Italy's number of cases won't drop to zero by mid-May, meaning that the infection will continue to circulate. Brusaffero said it will be extremely important to be able to identify possible outbreaks, carry out tests, tracing and isolation of contacts and eventually create red zones to contain the virus.On Monday, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is expected to hold a cabinet meeting, and on Wednesday he will talk with some of the regional governors to try and come up with a more coherent nationwide calendar for reopening.\"May 4 is a date around which we have to build Phase 2. I hope that there will be a meeting between the key figures as soon as possible ... but I want to be clear on one point: The battle is not won,\u201d Health Minister Roberto Speranza told Italian radio on Monday.Regarding the \"Immuni\" contact-tracing app, chosen by the government to track the spread of the virus in May, Speranza said it \"is one of the tools in this crisis.\"Speranza also stressed the importance of the question: \"How we will reopen?\" and not necessarily: \"When?\" \"We are now equipping ourselves with a national guideline on how to meet this challenge,\" Speranza added.Lombardy looks to emerge from lockdown: Last week Lombardy, the Italian region worst affected by coronavirus, where nearly half of the total number of deaths have been registered, presented guidelines for a reopening of production activities:'diagnosis and testing, digitalisation, social distancing, and rights of workers.Lombardy is one of the richest regions in the EU, according to the latest Eurostat figures.The reopening of businesses \"must take place in the maximum protection of health and sanitary provisions,\" the Lombardy region said Sunday in a statement.'However, the mayor of Milan, Beppe Sala, criticised the Lombardy region's plan in an interview with the Financial Times on Monday.'\"I am very critical of (Lombardy's governor) Fontana's proposal. Lifting restrictions too soon could lead to extreme consequences,\" he said.In an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Sala explained that next week, Milan would outline plans to reopen the city, reorganising public transport, staggering working hours to avoid rush hour, reopening schools, offering incentives to bars and restaurants, and a summer school option to help parents return to work.\"Three conditions are necessary to reopen,\" Sala explained. \"The first is trivial: We are notified in advance, because public transport cannot be reorganised in 48 hours. The second is fundamental: We do our part by reorganising, for example, transport and subways, but if the others don't do their part, everything becomes useless,\" Sala told the paper."}

Not all failings in testing and supplies are personally Trump's fault.But his'refusal to accept any responsibility'at all raises questions about what he thinks the presidency, a problem-solving job of last resort where the buck stops, is actually for.The President's plan to use Sunday's briefing to polish his own personal narrative became clear when he read out and held up a Wall Street Journal opinion column praising his leadership.He also played an out-of-context video of New York Democratic Gov.

However, Ardern said on Monday that the measures would continue until next Monday at 11.59 p.m.That means New Zealand will remain under strict lockdown measures -- which require all non-essential workers to remain home -- during the upcoming three-day weekend. Next Monday is a public holiday in New Zealand for Anzac Day, a day of remembrance for soldiers killed in conflict. The decision comes despite New Zealand seeing a dwindling number of coronavirus cases over the past few weeks. On Monday, New Zealand reported nine new cases, bringing the country's total reported to 1,440. Of those, 12 have died and 974 have recovered. What Ardern said: The prime minister praised New Zealanders, saying she couldn't be prouder of the start they made to curbing the spread of the virus.She noted that New Zealand had one of the highest testing rates in the world, with more than 85,000 tests completed. The country also has one of the lowest mortality rates and a low rate of transmission, with each case infecting less than one additional person, she said.\"My message to New Zealanders is that you have sacrificed too much to lose those gains now,\" Ardern said.What happens next? Next Monday, the country will move to a level 3 alert for two weeks. Cabinet will review whether to extend that on May 11. Under level 3, the country will still essentially be under lockdown, but there will be an easing of restrictions. Schools can open. People will be able to buy takeaway food, and take part in more recreational activities, such as swimming at the beach. Up to 10 people will be allowed to gather for weddings and funerals.'Alert level 3 does not permit more social activity, but would allow more economic activity like construction, manufacturing and forestry, Ardern said."}

While Bolsonaro has been pushing against strict restrictions, state and local governments in some of Brazil's hardest-hit areas have closed schools and all but essential businesses, with firefighters and police in the streets urging people to stay indoors.Last week, Bolsonaro fired his health minister after weeks of clashes over social isolation measures. During a news conference to introduce his new minister, he reiterated that businesses need to be reopened to ensure that the economic fallout isn't worse than the virus. Polls, however, show that a majority of Brazilians support social isolation.On Sunday, Bolsonaro's supporters also organized caravans in different cities.The background: Brazil has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in Latin America.

Fuji in our minds ... a single, solitary mountain,\" epidemiologist Dr. Larry Brilliant said.\"I don't think it's going to look like that. I think a better image is a wave of a tsunami, with echoed waves that follow. And it's up to us, how big those other waves will be,\" he added.Lesson #2: Young, healthy adults can be victims of their strong immune systemsYoung, healthy people are not invincible and their strong immune systems might work against them.\"In those cases, it is not an aged or weakened immune system that is the problem \u2014 it is one that works too well,\" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent'Dr. Sanjay Gupta'said. \"In some young, healthy people, a very reactive immune system could lead to a massive inflammatory storm that could overwhelm the lungs and other organs,\" he added.Lesson #3: Don't throw unproven drugs at the virusThe Spanish flu and the novel coronavirus pandemics share two major challenges: the lack of a vaccine and the lack of a cure.Back in 1918, remedies \"varied from the newly developed drugs to oils and herbs,\" according to'a Stanford University research post. \"The therapy was much less scientific than the diagnostics, as the drugs had no clear explanatory theory of action,\" the post said.In 2020, there is'widespread speculation'about whether'hydroxychloroquine'\u2013 a drug used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis \u2013 could help coronavirus patients.The bottom line: It's still not clear whether some drugs will cause more harm than good in the fight against coronavirus."}

Most experts think it's unlikely that somebody will be reinfected right after recovering. It's possible that issues with testing -- or varying amounts of viral RNA in the body, which the tests look for -- could explain why people test positive after testing negative, experts say.An in-depth epidemiological'investigation is underway to figure out the cause, Jung said.Among all of the cases who have retested positive, patients in their 20s made up the highest number, with 41 cases (22.9%), followed by patients in their 50s, with 32 cases (17.9%), according to the KCDC.Most such cases test positive after an average of about 13 days following release from quarantine, Jung added, and so far no secondary infections have been reported from these cases."}

Yet more than 60,000 people died in modern-day northeast China, making it one of the world's largest epidemics at the time.'When the disease was eventually brought under control, the Chinese government convened the International Plague Conference in the northern'city of Shenyang -- close to the epicenter of the outbreak.'In attendance were virologists, bacteriologists, epidemiologists and disease experts from many of the world's major powers -- the United States, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and France.The purpose of the conference:  Experts wanted to find the cause of the outbreak, learn which suppression techniques were most effective, discover why the disease had spread so far so fast, and assess what could be done to prevent a second wave.

Since March 17, Singapore's number of confirmed coronavirus cases grew from 266 to over 5,900,'according to data from Johns Hopkins University.'So what went wrong?'Migrant workers: The answer appears to lie in overlooked clusters of cases among migrant workers living in cramped dormitories and an underestimation of the speed at which those infections could spread through a city where lockdown measures had not been put in place.Life as normal: Because Singapore was testing widely and isolating all those who were potentially contagious, it was able to remain relatively open and continue functioning as usual. This attitude was only viable if infections from overseas were kept out, and new potential cases were detected and dealt with quickly.Rapid spread: Once this measure failed, the speed at which the virus could pass from person to person was greater than it would be in a place with heavy lockdown and social distancing measures.For more on how Singapore's experience shows relaxing too soon can backfire, read here:"}

The updated guidelines still need government approval, which is expected late Saturday night. The reduced restrictions will be evaluated for two weeks before any further decisions are made, Netanyahu said.Industrial and high-tech workplaces, as well as certain stores, will be allowed to reopen under health and social distancing restrictions. Employers must check the temperature of their workers upon arrival and limit the number of people in a room; maintaining at least 2 meters (6 feet) between each person.''Employers must document who enters offices and stores must document customers who enter. Employees must sign a health declaration before entering their workplace.The new rules notwithstanding, Netanyahu still encouraged employees to continue to work from home as much as possible.Stores that will be allowed to reopen include those selling furniture, household appliances, electronics, and communication devices.If an employee tests positive for coronavirus, the workplace will be required to close until it receives permission from the Health Ministry to reopen.Those over 67 years old, or with an existing health condition, should not return to work, said Health Ministry Director-General Moshe Bar Siman Tov.Israelis must remain within 100 meters (about 330 feet) of their residences, though they may travel up to 500 meters (1,640 feet) for exercise. Citizens are still required to wear face masks in public spaces and maintain a 2-meter (6-foot) distance from others.Schools and universities will remain closed, except for special needs education, which can be conducted in small groups, Netanyahu said.

The state of alarm was to end on April 26, but the planned extension calls for it to end on May 9. The plan extends Spain's strict lockdown to a total of eight weeks.\"Today it is not possible to lift the containment measures and go to phase two of de-escalation,\" Sanchez said at a news conference.The state of alarm was introduced March 14 and placed severe restrictions on movement and business. The extension will be presented to Parliament in the coming week.However, Sanchez said with the advice of experts, the government will lift the confinement of children as of April 27. He said the exception would \"be limited and subject to conditions to avoid contagion.\"Sanchez said after May 9, a \"cautious and progressive\" de-escalation would take place. \"We will be guided by a series of markers that will tell us of the spread of the virus and of the vigor of our health system, so that we know how the pandemic is evolving in each region,\" he said. The de-escalation may proceed at different rates in different regions, he said. But if any risk is detected, Sanchez said the de-escalation would be suspended.The state of alarm was slightly relaxed last Monday to allow some four million Spaniards to return to work in jobs like construction and manufacturing. But nonessential retail outlets, bars, cafes and other places of entertainment have remained closed, and Spain's lucrative tourism business remains halted.The National Police and Civil Guard continue to enforce a ban on all nonessential movement, and traffic on Spain's major roads is down by about 80% on pre-crisis levels."}
